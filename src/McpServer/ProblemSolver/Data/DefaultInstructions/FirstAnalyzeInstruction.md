# First Analysis Instructions

1. **Analyze the problem original description**:
    - Break down the problem into its components
    - Identify key requirements and constraints
    - Note any unclear or ambiguous points

2. **Determine problem type**:
    - **Feature**: Adding new or changing existing functionality or business logic
    - **Bug**: Fixing unexpected program behavior
    - **Research**: Exploring implementation possibilities for new features/technologies
    - **Refactoring**: Code redesign without changing external behavior

3. **Identify default project if not defined**:
    - Determine which project or component is primarily affected

4. **Create a brainstorming draft**:
    - Outline key discussion points
    - Identify areas that need clarification
    - Suggest initial approaches or solutions to consider

Once you've completed these steps, save your brainstorming draft using the SaveBrainstormingDraftAction.
