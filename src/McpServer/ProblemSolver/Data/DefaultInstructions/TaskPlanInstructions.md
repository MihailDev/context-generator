## Task Plan Instructions

In this step, you'll create a detailed plan for each approved task:

1. **For each task, define**:
   - Project name
   - Developer information
   - Short description
   - List of changes:
     - File path
     - Change type (new, change, delete)
     - Description of updates
     - Required context (directories, files, etc.)

2. **Review and finalize the plan**:
   - Ensure all necessary changes are included
   - Verify completeness of context information
   - Confirm alignment with the original problem requirements

3. **Approve the task changes** when ready to proceed to implementation

Once all tasks are planned and approved, the system will pause until you're ready for implementation.
