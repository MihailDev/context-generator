## Solve Task Instructions

In this step, you'll implement the changes defined in your task plan:

1. **For each change**:
   - Review the context and instructions
   - Implement the required modifications
   - Test the changes as appropriate
   - Document any challenges or deviations from the plan

2. **Submit each change** for review and integration

3. **Continue until all changes are complete**

The system will provide you with each change sequentially, along with the necessary context and specific instructions.
